# Fuel-cell-performance

## Description
This repository contains a Python script to evaluate the performance of various regression models using a sample dataset. The primary goal is to predict Target3 based on the provided features, compare different regression models and identify the best-performing model based on R² scores.

## The models evaluated include:

Linear Regression <br />
Random Forest Regressor <br />
Gradient Boosting Regressor <br />
Lasso Regression <br />
Ridge Regression <br />
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) <br />
Decision Tree Regressor <br />
Support Vector Regressor (SVR) <br />
The R² score is used as the performance metric, with higher values indicating better model performance.

## Results
The performance of the models is summarized below:

Model |	R² Score <br />
Linear Regression	|-0.0170 <br />
Random Forest	|-0.0540 <br />
Gradient Boosting	|-0.1198 <br />
Lasso Regression	|-0.0245 <br />
Ridge Regression|	-0.0163 (Best) <br />
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	|-0.2175 <br />
Decision Tree	|-1.3609 (Worst) <br />
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)	|-0.0249 <br />

## Best Model
Ridge Regression with an R² score of -0.0163

 ## Worst Model
Decision Tree Regressor with an R² score of -1.3609

## Sample 
Below is a sample bar chart generated by the script, showing the R² scores for different models:
